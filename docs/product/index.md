# Product Guides

Welcome to the Madevo Product Guides.

This section explains how to use the Madevo web application for the core product experiences. If you are integrating programmatically, refer to the API section in the main navigation.

## What You Can Do

Madevo provides three core UI workflows:

### 1. Datasource
Create and manage datasources so the platform can reason over your structured data.

➡ See: [Datasource (UI)](datasources-ui.md)

---

### 2. Assistant
Start conversations and query your datasources using natural language.

➡ See: [Assistant (UI)](assistant-ui.md)

---

### 3. Agent
Create repeatable AI-driven tasks that run structured instructions on selected datasources.

➡ See: [Agent (UI)](agent-ui.md)

---

## Data Standards

For reliable results, ensure your data follows the required formatting and naming standards.

➡ See: [Data Schema and Semantics](data-schema.md)

---

## UI vs API

- Use the **Product** guides if you are working in the web interface.
- Use the **API** section if you are integrating Madevo into another system or automating ingestion and execution workflows.

## Recommended Getting Started Flow

1. Create a datasource  
2. Validate it using preview  
3. Start a conversation in Assistant  
4. Create an Agent task for repeatable analysis  

This flow ensures your data is properly structured before running automated tasks.
